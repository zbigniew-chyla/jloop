# jloop - simple Java event loop library

The library lets you perform async i/o and scheduling async tasks with single thread, using simple event loop API.
Its basic design is similar to the "nosync" library I've implemented in C++.

There's no documentation currently. This is simply a group of classes extracted from my old Java project.
It will need some polishing to become a *real* library.
